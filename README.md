# TODO App using React

Welcome to the repository of the TODO App that I developed while learning React! This project is a simple yet functional TODO application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete tasks easily.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface.
- Uses React hooks for managing state.
- Convert tasks to uppercase.
- Bulk actions: Uppercase all tasks, mark all as done, or delete all tasks.
